# ControlScreen
## What is this?
ControlScreen is a little python tool to make randomized mouse movements, and to detect when a concrete (or anyone else) aplication window is open in our OS.

## How it works?
1) Unzip the app.
2) Double click for running. Posibly some antivirus detects the app like a virus, this is a false positive, don't care about that. 
3) The firs field ("Name to set:"), is for change the application name's. You can change it to wathever you like to make it seems like another app (camouflage).
4) The "Start Moving" button, starts to move our mouse randomizely. To stop this automatic movement, you can press "Alt + a"
5) In the screen control section, you cand find a checker "Any", if it is checked, the application detects wathever program would run since we press the button. We can unchek it, and automatically activates a field where we can writte for the name of an application (is not necesary the full name, we can writte it parcially), in that case, only if an application that contains the name wiritten in this field, opens, the alarm would sound. The checkbox "AlertSound" is for activate/deactivate the alarm sound. The checkbox "WhattsappAlert" is for activate/deactivate the whatsapp alert when the alarm is playing, if we want to activate it, when check the box, a new window opens, in this one we can to set aour phone number (with the region code), and we can test it or press Enter to stablish. Finally the "ControlScreen" button starts the control system based in our configuration, to stop it we can press "Alt + s".
